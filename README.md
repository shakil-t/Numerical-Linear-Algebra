# Numerical Linear Algebra
This repository contains my codes for the course Numerical Linear Algebra in 2018. Although being a theoretical course, I chose to do some optional projects which helped me enrich my knowledge in this case.\
The projects are the following:\
- Power Method
- Jacobi and Gauss Seidel Method
